            <li>Crab Meat Stockfish or dried fish</li></ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol> <li>Peel and cut the Yam into medium-sized chunks and rinse 
                a couple of times</li> <li>Put the Yams inside a Pot, add 
                    water just to the level of the Yams and let it cook 
                    for 15 minutes on medium to high heat</li>
                <li>Add the pepper sauce palm oil, onions, crayfish, salt, 
                    and stock cubes, and allow it to cook for an additional 
                    10 minutes on low heat.</li> <li>Add the crabmeat 
                        (You can use whatever addition you prefer at this 
                        point like, Smoked Fish, Prawns, or smoked 
                        Turkey.</li> <li>Mash the Yams with a Potato masher 
                            or a wooden spoon. I love to mash some yams 
                            and keep some chunks. Gives more texture!</li>
                        <li>Stir in the parsley (spinach, kale, or ugwu)</li>
                    <li>Allow it to simmer for an additional 3 to 5 minutes 
                        and enjoy while still hot!</li></ol>
